\section{Introduction}

The major innovations of the industrial revolution were not new products. Textiles, clothing, paper, iron and agricultural products all existed prior. The innovation lay in the method of creating textiles, clothes, and other goods through factories, assembly lines, and mass production.

Many other innovations have gone through similar cycles. Early websites were hand-crafted by a professional programmer, now a website builder can have something up and running in seconds.

Digital Twin technology is at a similar state to the hand-produced goods of the early 19th century. It has been proven benificial in a variety of industries, including the discipline of process engineering. 

However, the cost to develop a digital twin system is still high. This is because most are custom, manually written software systems. This is in part due to the inherent complexity of the task; no two factories are exactly the same. However, a generally-applicable method of building and running Digital Twin systems could make them accessible to more factories and processes, increasing their reliability and efficiency, reducing downtime and waste.
