\chapter{Literature Review}

This literature review analyses the most relevant literature on the development methodology used to build Digital Twins for chemical industries.

The design process of a number of Digital Twin Systems are compared, to show the common elements and challenges in building a digital twin system.

Then, some existing and emerging technologies are reviewed that may be helpful in creating a process for building digital twins.

\section{An Overview of Digital Twins}

% What characterises digital twin technology

% Use google maps as the digital twin example?

\subsection{Usage in Chemical and Process Engineering}

% Without going into detail, what are they used for?


% Should we talk about success metrics?

\section{Digital Twin Development Methodologies}

\subsection{Case study 1: ...}

\subsection{Case study 2: ...}

\subsection{Case study 3: ...}

\subsection{Discussion}
% Common elements of the design process
% challenges in building a digital twin system
% compatibility, complexity, security, privacy etc
% find some more specific challenges too.



\section{Digital Twin Development Tools in Chemical Engineering}


\subsection{Equation-oriented Modelling Tools}
% comparison



% Potential Comparison Table
% Language
% Supports importing from
% Supports exporting to
% Engineering Packages & Model Libraries
% ODE & PDE Support
% control integration?
% Created
% Popularity (active, # github stars, or something)
% Link to website
% Machine Learning Support
% Value Proposition (point of difference)



% maybe don't have a subsection for each, just a table explaining the differences


\subsubsection{Modelica Modelling Language}

Lots of libraries, https://modelica.org/libraries/, and good integration with other digital twin platforms e.g modelon. Development is spread more thinly and less new stuff coming out.


\subsubsection{Julia ModelingToolkit.jl}

More modern than modelica, seems to have good integration with different solvers


\subsubsection{Python Pyomo}

% SciML, https://github.com/SciML/SBMLToolkit.jl importing
% https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYkojUozeC4


\subsection{Digital Twin Platforms}


% Table for all of these?


\subsubsection{Modelon}
integration with Modelica 

\subsubsection{Collimator}
https://www.collimator.ai/


built on python and Jax

\subsubsection{JuliaSim}

\subsubsection{AspenTech} ???

\subsubsection{Honeywell} ???

\subsubsection{Siemens} ???

\subsubsection{AVEVA} ???

\subsubsection{Aspen Hysys} ???

\subsubsection{scilab-XCOS}
