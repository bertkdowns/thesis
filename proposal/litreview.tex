\section{Literature Review}

This literature review analyses the most relevant literature on the development methodology used to build Digital Twins for chemical industries.

The design process of a number of Digital Twin Systems are compared, to show the common elements and challenges in building a digital twin system.

Then, some existing and emerging technologies are reviewed that may be helpful in creating a process for building digital twins.

\subsection{An Overview of Digital Twins}

% What characterises digital twin technology


\subsubsection{Usage in Chemical and Process Engineering}

% Without going into detail, what are they used for?


% Should we talk about success metrics?

\subsection{Digital Twin Development Methodologies}

\subsubsection{Case study 1: ...}

\subsubsection{Case study 2: ...}

\subsubsection{Case study 3: ...}

\subsubsection{Discussion}
% Common elements of the design process
% challenges in building a digital twin system
% compatibility, complexity, security, privacy etc
% find some more specific challenges too.
