There is so much to do in so little time. Planning is key now.

# 2025 Q4 - Tidy-up time

- Write a paper on Degrees of Freedom Analysis and mathematical problem formulation.
- Draft a proposal interface for live data processing
- Draft a proposal interface for online learning
- Implement Dynamics support in the Ahuora Platform
- Implement 1d Unit Operations in the Ahuora Platform
- Find more methods to approximate solutions when you don't have enough measurements to solve (e.g parmest from design calcs?)

# 2026 Q1 - Getting real-time

- Summer Students
- Work with other students on implementing live data processing and online learning frameworks
- Update the unit operations system to allow adding more unit operations without as much code changes

# 2026 Q2 - Case Studies round 2

- Evaluate live data processing and online learning frameworks on case studies
- Identify the core principles/tenets that we should bake into the live data processing methodology
- Update implementations based on the evaluations.


# 2026 Q3 - Mid-PhD Hiatus

- CMU Visit
- Nonlinear programming optimization - relaxation for more reliable solves
- Upgrade the Ahuora unit operations to make solving much more reliable
- Write a paper somewhat related to this.

# 2026 Q4 - Disrupt the Industry

- Proposals for Summer Students - come up with project ideas (additional analysis tools?)
- Last major implementation push to refactor Ahuora platform and live data processing to work well together and be reliable
- Start talking to sites about having the ADTP running in real-time on their site.

# 2027 Q1 - Control and Narrative

- Summer Students - Additional analysis tools and UI improvements, better live data systems
- Write a paper on the overall development and direction of the PhD, pretty much a whitepaper on the digital twin side of the platform.
- Start looking into control strategies

# 2027 Q2 - Businessman

- Start writing thesis
- Add more control tools to the live systems
- Get the live systems working in real-time on a site, updating code as required.

# 2027 Q3 - The Final Sprint

- Main body of thesis, story done. Chapters on papers done.
- Start job hunt for post-PhD
- Continue working with sites to get the live systems working in real-time on a site.
- Start negotiating contracts.


# 2027 Q4 - Wrapping up

- Submit Thesis by November 30th 2027
- Work on turning case studies into contract work for Ahuora
- Find another job
- Prep for the summer students and provide good documentation of everything that has been done.
