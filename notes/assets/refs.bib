abstract = {Food Processing Industries are bound to increasingly adopt digital technologies in order to ensure product safety and quality, minimize costs in the face of low profit margins, shorten lead times and guarantee timely delivery of an increasing number of products despite production dead times and uncertainties. The concept of a digital twin put forward in the context of Industry 4.0 encompasses a digital model of the production model that mimics the physical system, interacts with it and can be used to design, monitor and optimize its performance. In this paper, the application of integrated process and digital twin models in food processing is discussed in the context of process simulation and production scheduling. The modeling challenges, opportunities and special characteristics that distinguish food from other process industries are also discussed. The potential benefits from implementing a digital modeling approach on a food process are presented with the help of a large-scale brewery case study.}

"The DEXPI was launched to address the challenges of data exchange and
integration in the process industry. It promotes the use of a standardized
information model and data exchange format based on industry-specific
standards such as ISO 15926 and ISO 18629. The goal is to enable efficient
data exchange between different engineering disciplines and software tools
involved in the lifecycle of a process plant, including process design, simulation,
operation, and maintenance.

One of the key advantages of DEXPI is its ability to enable seamless data
exchange between various software applications used in different stages of a
process plant's lifecycle"

This article talks about how to get a PID
Diagram and convert it into a simulation using the
BALAS simualtion software and a couple custom tools.

This is really interesting, and we need to think about it a lot more.
We could implement some of these techniques.

There is some manual stuff to do, but their usage of steady-state is similar to ours.

See Figure 2 in the publication : 

Some Links:

DEXPI is a digital standard for PID diagrams, the first step is making the PID PDF converted to dexpi.
DEXPI github: https://gitlab.com/dexpi
DEXPI Specification: https://dexpi.org/specifications/
a better article that educates about DEXPI so you don't have to just 
read the spec: https://www.theseus.fi/bitstream/handle/10024/809906/Paavilainen_Joel.pdf?sequence=2&isAllowed=y


Then a graph model is created using some software called Graph_Generator, which I presume is custom.
Simplification of the P&ID is also done using some custom software called Component_selector

I assume hardcoded software specific mapping rules are used, then Flowsheet_Populator is used to convert it into a digital model in Balas.

VTT BALAS overview: (may not be helpful) https://www.vttresearch.com/en/explore/vtt-balas-conceptual-process-design-optimise-resource-efficiency
Simantics platforms: May also be a parent organisation of BALAS https://www.simantics.org/demonstration/
Their stuff also includes a system dynamics tool and APROS 6 another simulation environment. 
Their github includes the core platform https://gitlab.simantics.org/simantics and instructions to compile it, libraries to work with Functional Mockup Units, District Network Modelling, etc. These guys seem to have a platform similar to ours, written in Java, with PGraph integration, district network modelling, and 3d modelling, automation, and dynamics. Gonna try build it locally when I can.
A paper on their platform is found at https://sarjaweb.vtt.fi/julkaisut/muut/2012/S1793962312500043.pdf

abstract = {Current advances in computer-aided chemical process design and synthesis take advantage of surrogate modelling and superstructure optimization techniques. Conventionally, this is completed by using first-principle physical models or data-driven models to replace the original rigorous models for optimization and selection of a specific unit operation. Despite its achievements, this strategy is inefficient when dealing with complex process flowsheets such as utility and refrigeration systems where a large number of unit operations are heavily connected by recycling streams. To address this problem, an integrated data-driven modelling and optimization framework is proposed in this work. The framework first constructs a hybrid machine learning based surrogate model to automatically reduce the system dimensionality and capture the nonlinearity of the underlying chemical process. Then, an efficient optimization algorithm, in specific, evolutionary algorithm, is embedded to identify the optimal solution of this surrogate model. Quality and accuracy of the estimated optimal solution is finally validated against the rigorous process model. Through an iterative approach, optimal operating conditions for the entire process flowsheet are efficiently identified. Furthermore, the novel CryoMan Cascade cycle system for large scale liquefied natural gas manufacturing is used as the case study. This framework is demonstrated to be superior regarding time-efficiency, solution quality, and flexibility over the rigorous model based optimization approach.}

Using kernel density estimation and nearest neighbour algorithms, sparse regions are identified and resampled, developing a more balanced dataset. When applied to a real dataset from a geothermal power plant, Covert outperforms current best practice (Smote) in uniformly populating the input feature space and generating credible data in the output variable. When used to develop a data-driven model Covert improved model accuracy by 20% when predicting outside the original data’s feature space. Smote, however, reduced model accuracy by 6% in the same feature space. Developing reliable models of industrial processes continues to be a significant hurdle in developing a digital twin. Using Covert, existing imbalanced historical data can be used to extend the range of applicability of any process model.}

In this work, the physical systems are operations and processes from energy-intensive industrial plants and their local communities. The creation of DTs demands expertise not just in engineering, but also in computer science, data science, and artificial intelligence. Here, we introduce the Adaptive Digital Twins (ADT) concept, anchored in five attributes inspired by the self-adaptive systems field from software engineering. These attributes are self-learning, self-optimizing, self-evolving, self-monitoring, and self-protection. This new approach merges cutting-edge computing with pragmatic engineering needs. ADTs can enhance decision-making in both the design phase and real-time operation of industrial facilities and allow for versatile 'what-if' scenario simulations. Seven applications within the energy-intensive industries are described where ADTs could be transformative.}

The softwarized object, termed logical object, reflects all the important properties and characteristics of the original object within a specific application context. To fully determine the expected properties of the DT, this article surveys the state-of-the-art starting from the original definition within the manufacturing industry. It takes into account related proposals emerging in other fields, namely augmented and virtual reality (e.g., avatars), multiagent systems, and virtualization. This survey thereby allows for the identification of an extensive set of DT features that point to the “softwarization” of POs. To properly consolidate a shared DT definition, a set of foundational properties is identified and proposed as a common ground outlining the essential characteristics (must-haves) of a DT. Once the DT definition has been consolidated, its technical and business value is discussed in terms of applicability and opportunities. Four application scenarios illustrate how the DT concept can be used and how some industries are applying it. The scenarios also lead to a generic DT architectural model. This analysis is then complemented by the identification of software architecture models and guidelines in order to present a general functional framework for the DT. This article, eventually, analyses a set of possible evolution paths for the DT considering its possible usage as a major enabler for the softwarization process.},

This paper presents an urban road planning approach based on digital twin (DT), MCDM, and GIS called DT-MCDM-GIS framework. DT can digitalize the physical world to provide various data for the whole process; MCDM can provide criteria and evaluation methods; GIS can provide an integrated environment for analysis. Building demolition and land use, traffic congestion, driving route selection habits, air quality, and noise are all considered in the framework for urban road planning. The proposed approach can provide a functional, economic, people-friendly, eco-friendly urban road planning scheme considering new road construction and existing old road widening to alleviate traffic congestion and provide an alternative route for drivers that conforms to their habits.}

    abstract = { Recent technological developments and advances in artificial intelligence (AI) have enabled sophisticated capabilities to be a part of digital twins (DTs), virtually making it possible to introduce automation into all aspects of work processes. Given these possibilities that DT can offer, practitioners are facing increasingly difficult decisions regarding what capabilities to select when deploying a DT in practice. The lack of research in this field has not helped. It has resulted in the rebranding and reuse of emerging technological capabilities such as prediction, simulation, AI, and machine learning (ML) as necessary constituents of DT. Inappropriate selection of capabilities in a DT can result in missed opportunities, strategic misalignments, inflated expectations, and the risk of it being rejected as hype by the practitioners. To alleviate this challenge, this paper proposes a digitalization framework, designed and developed by following a design science research (DSR) methodology over a period of 18\&nbsp;months. The framework can help practitioners select an appropriate level of sophistication in a DT by weighing the pros and cons for each level, determining evaluation criteria for the digital twin system, and assessing the implications of the selected DT on the organizational processes and strategies and value creation. Three real-life case studies illustrated the application and usefulness of the framework. }

abstract = {Hierarchical optimization modeling in an algebraic modeling environment facilitates construction of large models with many interchangeable sub-models. However, for dynamic simulation and optimization applications, a flattened structure that preserves time indexing is preferred. To convert from a structure that facilitates model construction to a structure that facilitates dynamic optimization, the concept of reshaping an optimization model is introduced along with the recently developed utilities in the Pyomo algebraic modeling environment that make this possible. The application of these utilities to model predictive control simulations and partial differential equation (PDE) discretization stability analysis is discussed, and two challenging nonlinear model predictive control case studies are presented to demonstrate the advantages of this approach.}

The coupling uses a standardized XML format for exchange of differential-algebraic equations (DAE) models. OpenModelica supports export of models written in Modelica and the optimization language extension using this XML format, while CasADi supports import of models represented in this format. This allows users to define optimal control problems (OCP) using Modelica and optimization language specification, and solve the underlying model formulation using a range of optimization methods, including direct collocation and direct multiple shooting. The proposed solution has been tested on several industrially relevant optimal control problems, including a diesel-electric power train.}

A digital twin is a digital representation of a physical asset that mirrors its data model, behaviour, and interactions with other physical assets. Digital Twin aims at achieving adaptability, seamless data integration, modelling, simulation, automation, and real-time data management. The primary goal of this article is to explore the role of agents in DT implementations, seeking to understand their predominant usage scenarios and purposes. From our perspective, agents serving as intelligent entities play a role in realising the features of DTs. This article also discusses the gaps in DT, highlights future directions, and analyses various technologies integrated with multi-agent systems technologies in DT implementations. Finally, the article briefly discusses an overview of an architecture to implement a DT for smart agriculture with multi-agents.},

In this paper, a Python software package is described that allows for model-based parameter estimation along with characterization of the uncertainty associated with the estimates. The software, called parmest, is available within the Pyomo open-source software project as a third-party contribution. The software includes options to obtain confidence regions that are based on single or multi-variate distributions, compute likelihood ratios, use bootstrap resampling in estimation, and make use of parallel processing capabilities.}

abstract = {The foundry industry with its casting processes and conditions create the basis for the quality of the final metallic components. The control of the process parameters is therefore of primary importance. Topics such as Industry 4.0, digitalisation, Internet of Things or Big Data allowing for a new grade of process monitoring but so far are mainly practiced by a few large foundries, which have started early with the digitalisation of their processes due to the high degree of automation already in place. Small and medium-sized foundries on the other hand often struggle with these issues. Concrete, comprehensible solutions are missing from the point of view of many medium-sized foundries without competences in the new IT-related topics. As the innovative backbone of industry, however, SMEs must also find and enter into this new world of manufacturing. Taking the example of, but not limited to, SME aluminium foundries, the topic presented here therefore aims at a basic and practicable approach for the digital monitoring of the most important process parameters during the production of aluminium castings. The Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT) communication protocol in combination with suitable microcontrollers, sensor technology as well as corresponding professional open-source software could provide a comprehensive, cost-effective infrastructure for real-time monitoring and visualisation of all relevant process data. In the sense of horizontal integration, the work demonstrates an implementable concept for the appropriate integration of the necessary components and their software-technical linking as well as the associated potential for process transparency, reproducibility and sustainability.}

abstract = {The push towards Industry 4.0 is constraining the industries to work in integrated supply chains. This implies to be open to the integration their production plants with other plants, and to provide access to their data and processes. In most cases, this also means to give access at data and flows to their customers to perform some synchronizations, permit supervision, and to create integrated control rooms, with synoptics and dashboards. This activity is also facilitated by the introduction of IoT solutions with IoT Devices, IoT Brokers, etc., which have a completely different approach with respect to DCS and SCADA solutions usually adopted in the industry for controlling their local productions. In this paper, Snap4Industry with its IoT development environment and framework for implementing the Control and Supervision of complex plant with multiple DCS and/or chains in the view of Industry 4.0 is presented. In particular, the paper describes the motivations/requirements and the actions performed to extend IoT Snap4City 100% open-source platform to comply with Industry 4.0 requirements. The main additions for creating Snap4Industry solution have been on: (i) industry protocols, (ii) custom widgets and synoptics Dashboards, (iii) new MicroServices for Node-RED for enabling the usage of synoptics as event driven devices, (iv) usage of WebSocket secure for the communication with custom Synoptics and Widgets for dashboards, automatized process for producing synoptics templates according to GDPR, and (v) the possibility of creating integrated workflows from data ingestion to synoptics. The paper also presents the assessment of the solution in terms of volume data and messages exchanged. The research has been founded into SODA R&D project founded by Regional Tuscany Gov.}

abstract = {This paper describes a model of an industrial chemical process for the purpose of developing, studying and evaluating process control technology. This process is well suited for a wide variety of studies including both plant-wide control and multivariable control problems. It consists of a reactor/ separator/recycle arrangement involving two simultaneous gas—liquid exothermic reactions of the following form: A(g) + C(g) + D(g) → G(liq), Product 1, A(g) + C(g) + E(g) → H(liq), Product 2. Two additional byproduct reactions also occur. The process has 12 valves available for manipulation and 41 measurements available for monitoring or control. The process equipment, operating objectives, process control objectives and process disturbances are described. A set of FORTRAN subroutines which simulate the process are available upon request. The chemical process model presented here is a challenging problem for a wide variety of process control technology studies. Even though this process has only a few unit operations, it is much more complex than it appears on first examination. We hope that this problem will be useful in the development of the process control field. We are also interested in hearing about applications of the problem.}

abstract = {Non-routine operating conditions in process plants can hinder safe operation and effective control due to limited understanding of system behavior. Therefore, it is desirable that process digital twins are capable of accurately extrapolating system behavior beyond the scenarios typically encountered. Physics-informed neural networks, which integrate data-driven models with physics constraints, offer a promising solution to this challenge. However, the constraints often fail to accurately represent the physics of chemical engineering unit operations and rigorously enforcing these constraints throughout training may compromise predictive accuracy. Furthermore, many studies focus on complex scenarios that require detailed equations, which may not be available for industrial plants or may be in fact unnecessary depending on the specific behavior being modeled. This study presents a novel approach to training digital twins for extrapolation by combining physics-informed neural networks with meta-learning, enabling the model to dynamically change the weight term of each governing differential equation throughout training. This method is applied to data from an industrial geothermal heat exchanger, using only the governing mass and energy balance partial differential equations as a part of the loss functions and excluding detailed heat transfer processes. The proposed approach eliminates the need for complex heat transfer models in predicting the outlet temperatures of geothermal heat exchangers. The meta-learning physics-informed neural network performed significantly better for the case study situations tested in this work (R2=0.97), at the cost of nearly 30 times higher training time. The results highlight the potential of this approach to create high-fidelity digital twins for industrial applications.}
