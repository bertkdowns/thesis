abstract = {Food Processing Industries are bound to increasingly adopt digital technologies in order to ensure product safety and quality, minimize costs in the face of low profit margins, shorten lead times and guarantee timely delivery of an increasing number of products despite production dead times and uncertainties. The concept of a digital twin put forward in the context of Industry 4.0 encompasses a digital model of the production model that mimics the physical system, interacts with it and can be used to design, monitor and optimize its performance. In this paper, the application of integrated process and digital twin models in food processing is discussed in the context of process simulation and production scheduling. The modeling challenges, opportunities and special characteristics that distinguish food from other process industries are also discussed. The potential benefits from implementing a digital modeling approach on a food process are presented with the help of a large-scale brewery case study.}

"The DEXPI was launched to address the challenges of data exchange and
integration in the process industry. It promotes the use of a standardized
information model and data exchange format based on industry-specific
standards such as ISO 15926 and ISO 18629. The goal is to enable efficient
data exchange between different engineering disciplines and software tools
involved in the lifecycle of a process plant, including process design, simulation,
operation, and maintenance.

One of the key advantages of DEXPI is its ability to enable seamless data
exchange between various software applications used in different stages of a
process plant's lifecycle"

This article talks about how to get a PID
Diagram and convert it into a simulation using the
BALAS simualtion software and a couple custom tools.

This is really interesting, and we need to think about it a lot more.
We could implement some of these techniques.

There is some manual stuff to do, but their usage of steady-state is similar to ours.

See Figure 2 in the publication : 

Some Links:

DEXPI is a digital standard for PID diagrams, the first step is making the PID PDF converted to dexpi.
DEXPI github: https://gitlab.com/dexpi
DEXPI Specification: https://dexpi.org/specifications/
a better article that educates about DEXPI so you don't have to just 
read the spec: https://www.theseus.fi/bitstream/handle/10024/809906/Paavilainen_Joel.pdf?sequence=2&isAllowed=y


Then a graph model is created using some software called Graph_Generator, which I presume is custom.
Simplification of the P&ID is also done using some custom software called Component_selector

I assume hardcoded software specific mapping rules are used, then Flowsheet_Populator is used to convert it into a digital model in Balas.

VTT BALAS overview: (may not be helpful) https://www.vttresearch.com/en/explore/vtt-balas-conceptual-process-design-optimise-resource-efficiency
Simantics platforms: May also be a parent organisation of BALAS https://www.simantics.org/demonstration/
Their stuff also includes a system dynamics tool and APROS 6 another simulation environment. 
Their github includes the core platform https://gitlab.simantics.org/simantics and instructions to compile it, libraries to work with Functional Mockup Units, District Network Modelling, etc. These guys seem to have a platform similar to ours, written in Java, with PGraph integration, district network modelling, and 3d modelling, automation, and dynamics. Gonna try build it locally when I can.
A paper on their platform is found at https://sarjaweb.vtt.fi/julkaisut/muut/2012/S1793962312500043.pdf

abstract = {Current advances in computer-aided chemical process design and synthesis take advantage of surrogate modelling and superstructure optimization techniques. Conventionally, this is completed by using first-principle physical models or data-driven models to replace the original rigorous models for optimization and selection of a specific unit operation. Despite its achievements, this strategy is inefficient when dealing with complex process flowsheets such as utility and refrigeration systems where a large number of unit operations are heavily connected by recycling streams. To address this problem, an integrated data-driven modelling and optimization framework is proposed in this work. The framework first constructs a hybrid machine learning based surrogate model to automatically reduce the system dimensionality and capture the nonlinearity of the underlying chemical process. Then, an efficient optimization algorithm, in specific, evolutionary algorithm, is embedded to identify the optimal solution of this surrogate model. Quality and accuracy of the estimated optimal solution is finally validated against the rigorous process model. Through an iterative approach, optimal operating conditions for the entire process flowsheet are efficiently identified. Furthermore, the novel CryoMan Cascade cycle system for large scale liquefied natural gas manufacturing is used as the case study. This framework is demonstrated to be superior regarding time-efficiency, solution quality, and flexibility over the rigorous model based optimization approach.}

Using kernel density estimation and nearest neighbour algorithms, sparse regions are identified and resampled, developing a more balanced dataset. When applied to a real dataset from a geothermal power plant, Covert outperforms current best practice (Smote) in uniformly populating the input feature space and generating credible data in the output variable. When used to develop a data-driven model Covert improved model accuracy by 20% when predicting outside the original data’s feature space. Smote, however, reduced model accuracy by 6% in the same feature space. Developing reliable models of industrial processes continues to be a significant hurdle in developing a digital twin. Using Covert, existing imbalanced historical data can be used to extend the range of applicability of any process model.}

In this work, the physical systems are operations and processes from energy-intensive industrial plants and their local communities. The creation of DTs demands expertise not just in engineering, but also in computer science, data science, and artificial intelligence. Here, we introduce the Adaptive Digital Twins (ADT) concept, anchored in five attributes inspired by the self-adaptive systems field from software engineering. These attributes are self-learning, self-optimizing, self-evolving, self-monitoring, and self-protection. This new approach merges cutting-edge computing with pragmatic engineering needs. ADTs can enhance decision-making in both the design phase and real-time operation of industrial facilities and allow for versatile 'what-if' scenario simulations. Seven applications within the energy-intensive industries are described where ADTs could be transformative.}

The softwarized object, termed logical object, reflects all the important properties and characteristics of the original object within a specific application context. To fully determine the expected properties of the DT, this article surveys the state-of-the-art starting from the original definition within the manufacturing industry. It takes into account related proposals emerging in other fields, namely augmented and virtual reality (e.g., avatars), multiagent systems, and virtualization. This survey thereby allows for the identification of an extensive set of DT features that point to the “softwarization” of POs. To properly consolidate a shared DT definition, a set of foundational properties is identified and proposed as a common ground outlining the essential characteristics (must-haves) of a DT. Once the DT definition has been consolidated, its technical and business value is discussed in terms of applicability and opportunities. Four application scenarios illustrate how the DT concept can be used and how some industries are applying it. The scenarios also lead to a generic DT architectural model. This analysis is then complemented by the identification of software architecture models and guidelines in order to present a general functional framework for the DT. This article, eventually, analyses a set of possible evolution paths for the DT considering its possible usage as a major enabler for the softwarization process.},

This paper presents an urban road planning approach based on digital twin (DT), MCDM, and GIS called DT-MCDM-GIS framework. DT can digitalize the physical world to provide various data for the whole process; MCDM can provide criteria and evaluation methods; GIS can provide an integrated environment for analysis. Building demolition and land use, traffic congestion, driving route selection habits, air quality, and noise are all considered in the framework for urban road planning. The proposed approach can provide a functional, economic, people-friendly, eco-friendly urban road planning scheme considering new road construction and existing old road widening to alleviate traffic congestion and provide an alternative route for drivers that conforms to their habits.}

    abstract = { Recent technological developments and advances in artificial intelligence (AI) have enabled sophisticated capabilities to be a part of digital twins (DTs), virtually making it possible to introduce automation into all aspects of work processes. Given these possibilities that DT can offer, practitioners are facing increasingly difficult decisions regarding what capabilities to select when deploying a DT in practice. The lack of research in this field has not helped. It has resulted in the rebranding and reuse of emerging technological capabilities such as prediction, simulation, AI, and machine learning (ML) as necessary constituents of DT. Inappropriate selection of capabilities in a DT can result in missed opportunities, strategic misalignments, inflated expectations, and the risk of it being rejected as hype by the practitioners. To alleviate this challenge, this paper proposes a digitalization framework, designed and developed by following a design science research (DSR) methodology over a period of 18\&nbsp;months. The framework can help practitioners select an appropriate level of sophistication in a DT by weighing the pros and cons for each level, determining evaluation criteria for the digital twin system, and assessing the implications of the selected DT on the organizational processes and strategies and value creation. Three real-life case studies illustrated the application and usefulness of the framework. }

abstract = {Hierarchical optimization modeling in an algebraic modeling environment facilitates construction of large models with many interchangeable sub-models. However, for dynamic simulation and optimization applications, a flattened structure that preserves time indexing is preferred. To convert from a structure that facilitates model construction to a structure that facilitates dynamic optimization, the concept of reshaping an optimization model is introduced along with the recently developed utilities in the Pyomo algebraic modeling environment that make this possible. The application of these utilities to model predictive control simulations and partial differential equation (PDE) discretization stability analysis is discussed, and two challenging nonlinear model predictive control case studies are presented to demonstrate the advantages of this approach.}

abstract = {This paper demonstrates model-based dynamic optimization through the coupling of two open source tools: OpenModelica, which is a Modelica-based modeling and simulation platform, and CasADi, a framework for numerical optimization. The coupling uses a standardized XML format for exchange of differential-algebraic equations (DAE) models. OpenModelica supports export of models written in Modelica and the optimization language extension using this XML format, while CasADi supports import of models represented in this format. This allows users to define optimal control problems (OCP) using Modelica and optimization language specification, and solve the underlying model formulation using a range of optimization methods, including direct collocation and direct multiple shooting. The proposed solution has been tested on several industrially relevant optimal control problems, including a diesel-electric power train.}
