abstract = {Digital Twins (DTs) are high-fidelity virtual models that behave-like, look-like and connect-to a physical system. In this work, the physical systems are operations and processes from energy-intensive industrial plants and their local communities. The creation of DTs demands expertise not just in engineering, but also in computer science, data science, and artificial intelligence. Here, we introduce the Adaptive Digital Twins (ADT) concept, anchored in five attributes inspired by the self-adaptive systems field from software engineering. These attributes are self-learning, self-optimizing, self-evolving, self-monitoring, and self-protection. This new approach merges cutting-edge computing with pragmatic engineering needs. ADTs can enhance decision-making in both the design phase and real-time operation of industrial facilities and allow for versatile 'what-if' scenario simulations. Seven applications within the energy-intensive industries are described where ADTs could be transformative.}

	abstract = {Digital twin (DT) is an emerging concept that is gaining attention in various industries. It refers to the ability to clone a physical object (PO) into a software counterpart. The softwarized object, termed logical object, reflects all the important properties and characteristics of the original object within a specific application context. To fully determine the expected properties of the DT, this article surveys the state-of-the-art starting from the original definition within the manufacturing industry. It takes into account related proposals emerging in other fields, namely augmented and virtual reality (e.g., avatars), multiagent systems, and virtualization. This survey thereby allows for the identification of an extensive set of DT features that point to the “softwarization” of POs. To properly consolidate a shared DT definition, a set of foundational properties is identified and proposed as a common ground outlining the essential characteristics (must-haves) of a DT. Once the DT definition has been consolidated, its technical and business value is discussed in terms of applicability and opportunities. Four application scenarios illustrate how the DT concept can be used and how some industries are applying it. The scenarios also lead to a generic DT architectural model. This analysis is then complemented by the identification of software architecture models and guidelines in order to present a general functional framework for the DT. This article, eventually, analyses a set of possible evolution paths for the DT considering its possible usage as a major enabler for the softwarization process.},

abstract = {The Digital Twin (DT) is commonly known as a key enabler for the digital transformation, however, in literature is no common understanding concerning this term. It is used slightly different over the disparate disciplines. The aim of this paper is to provide a categorical literature review of the DT in manufacturing and to classify existing publication according to their level of integration of the DT. Therefore, it is distinct between Digital Model (DM), Digital Shadow (DS) and Digital Twin. The results are showing, that literature concerning the highest development stage, the DT, is scarce, whilst there is more literature about DM and DS.}

abstract = {Sustainable urban road planning should endeavor to meet current and future traffic-related demands and achieve financial, environmental, and social benefits, which is a complex and interdisciplinary issue that needs to consider various factors and data. Multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) can provide reasonable solutions, and some existing studies integrated MCDM with geographic information system (GIS) technology. This paper presents an urban road planning approach based on digital twin (DT), MCDM, and GIS called DT-MCDM-GIS framework. DT can digitalize the physical world to provide various data for the whole process; MCDM can provide criteria and evaluation methods; GIS can provide an integrated environment for analysis. Building demolition and land use, traffic congestion, driving route selection habits, air quality, and noise are all considered in the framework for urban road planning. The proposed approach can provide a functional, economic, people-friendly, eco-friendly urban road planning scheme considering new road construction and existing old road widening to alleviate traffic congestion and provide an alternative route for drivers that conforms to their habits.}

    abstract = { Recent technological developments and advances in artificial intelligence (AI) have enabled sophisticated capabilities to be a part of digital twins (DTs), virtually making it possible to introduce automation into all aspects of work processes. Given these possibilities that DT can offer, practitioners are facing increasingly difficult decisions regarding what capabilities to select when deploying a DT in practice. The lack of research in this field has not helped. It has resulted in the rebranding and reuse of emerging technological capabilities such as prediction, simulation, AI, and machine learning (ML) as necessary constituents of DT. Inappropriate selection of capabilities in a DT can result in missed opportunities, strategic misalignments, inflated expectations, and the risk of it being rejected as hype by the practitioners. To alleviate this challenge, this paper proposes a digitalization framework, designed and developed by following a design science research (DSR) methodology over a period of 18\&nbsp;months. The framework can help practitioners select an appropriate level of sophistication in a DT by weighing the pros and cons for each level, determining evaluation criteria for the digital twin system, and assessing the implications of the selected DT on the organizational processes and strategies and value creation. Three real-life case studies illustrated the application and usefulness of the framework. }
