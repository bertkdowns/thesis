#  A Software Platform to Accelerate the Implementation of Process Digital Twins 

**Bert Downs**  
Supervised by Tim Walmsley, Jason Kurz, Mark Apperley  

**March 2025**

## Abstract

Digital Twins are a transformative technology in industrial chemical processes, offering significant potential to enhance efficiency, reliability, and sustainability. 
This research proposes a software engineering approach to the design and application of Digital Twins, focusing on reducing development costs and increasing their value to industry. 
Leveraging the Ahuora Digital Twin Platform, the project aims to standardize workflows, integrate advanced modeling techniques, and explore applications that enable dynamic simulation, machine learning, and real-time control. 
Key challenges in interoperability, scalability, and adaptability will be addressed, contributing to the broader adoption of Digital Twins in New Zealand's process industries. 
Through case studies and theoretical analysis, this work seeks to establish a generalizable framework for Process Digital Twin development, bridging the gap between academic research and industrial practice.
