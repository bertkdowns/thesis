# Control

We already have PID controllers in the system. I think we are pretty close to doing model predictive control.

I don't think we actually want to be using the ahuora platform to do PID control, there are much better, simpler tools for that. But Model Predictive control - maybe. to do so, we'd have to integrate with something like node-red, which is very possible. However, we probably need some case studies on model predictive control that we can try first.

# What case studies on Model Predictive Control do we have?
