% Segue from lit review, talking about what gaps and potential new research ideas there are.


% talk about the need for a generalised method of building digital twins, and how this could be achieved.


% From the literature, start to identify some of the key characteristics that will aid in the development of a generalised method of building digital twins.


% Discuss research questions, methodology for development - pull from the proposal i've already written.

- Wrap up by explaining how you can tell if the project is successful.
