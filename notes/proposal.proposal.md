<!---
% Segue from lit review, talking about what gaps and potential new research ideas there are.


% talk about the need for a generalised method of building digital twins, and how this could be achieved.


% From the literature, start to identify some of the key characteristics that will aid in the development of a generalised method of building digital twins.


% Discuss research questions, methodology for development - pull from the proposal i've already written.

- Wrap up by explaining how you can tell if the project is successful.

# Proposal

## Research Aims and Questions

<!---
The core questions or hypotheses you're trying to answer.
Often phrased clearly and precisely, e.g.:
"To investigate whether..."
"How can X be improved by Y?"
-->

This project aims to andwer the following research questions:

*How do existing standards and frameworks (e.g., DEXPI, Modelica, OPC UA) influence the interoperability and scalability of Digital Twin systems in chemical and process engineering?*

*What role do emerging technologies, such as online learning and surrogate modeling, play in reducing the cost and complexity of developing Digital Twins for legacy industrial systems?*


*How do Digital Twins evolve traditional control systems, and what are the implications for feedback loop design in autonomous industrial processes?*


## Methodology
<!--
How will you answer your research questions?
Details of methods, experiments, case studies, simulations, or theoretical frameworks.
