# Pressure Flow solving

Aspen Hysys has a pressure flow sovler, where the pressure is used to calculate the flow, or vice versa. 

With a valve in IDAES you can do the same thing. You can specify

- Inlet Temperature
- Inlet Pressure
- Valve Coefficient
- Valve Opening Fraction
- Outlet Pressure

and it will calculate the inlet and outlet flow rates for that pressure drop, valve position, and valve coefficient.
