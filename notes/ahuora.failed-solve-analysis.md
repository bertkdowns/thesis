When we are doing multi-steady-state, and we have some solves are failing, it would be really good to be able to provide some statistics on why a solve was failing, i.e is there any particular clusters/predictors of when it is failing to solve? E.g pairplot all input variables, classify by "row solved" or "row didn't solve".
