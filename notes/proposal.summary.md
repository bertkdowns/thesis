## Conclusion

This proposal has outlined a comprehensive approach to advancing the design and application of Digital Twins in industrial chemical processes. By leveraging the Ahuora Digital Twin Platform, this research aims to address critical challenges in interoperability, scalability, and adaptability, while integrating advanced modeling techniques and machine learning. Through iterative development and industry case studies, the project seeks to establish a standardized framework for Digital Twin development, bridging the gap between academic research and industrial practice. The anticipated outcomes include not only theoretical contributions to the field but also practical tools and methodologies that can transform New Zealand's process industries. Ultimately, this work aspires to make Digital Twins more accessible, cost-effective, and impactful, paving the way for their broader adoption and long-term sustainability.
