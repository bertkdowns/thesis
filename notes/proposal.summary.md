## Conclusion

Digital Twins are becoming more common in Industrial processes, as the technology matures. However, each DT is still mostly a custom solution. The Ahuora Digital Twin Platform is well positioned to become a tool to speed up the development of Digital Twins, as long as it is built in such a way that enables using a variety of technologies for modelling, data collection, analysis, and control. By basing the Ahuora Platform on top of existing standards and tools, it is anticipated this task will become simpler and more useful to existing plants. By building the Ahuora Platform iteratively, and using real-world case studies to guide the architecture, it is anticipated that a more universal method to build Digital Twins will be discovered.
