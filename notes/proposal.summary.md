# Conclusion

Digital Twins are becoming increasingly common in industrial processes as the technology matures. However, most implementations remain custom solutions, limiting their scalability and broader adoption. The Ahuora Digital Twin Platform is well-positioned to accelerate the development of Digital Twins by enabling the use of diverse technologies for modeling, data collection, analysis, and control. By building the platform iteratively and grounding its architecture in real-world case studies, this research aims to create a more universal and practical method for Digital Twin development. Furthermore, by aligning the platform with existing standards and tools, it is anticipated that the Ahuora Platform will simplify integration and deliver greater value to existing industrial plants, paving the way for more widespread adoption of Digital Twin technology.
