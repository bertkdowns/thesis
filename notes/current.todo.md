# LSL Heat Pump Digital Twin

- get a USB to TTL adapter and test that the modbus snooping script works (including uploading to MQTT)
- Connect up all the sensors to the DAQ and read them into MQTT
- Get a laptop to run all of that stuff down in the lab

- What could we do to use the ahuora platform to DT it? What can we calculate?

## Potential extras for Steam Generating Heat Pump

- get a PLC and start programming a control system


# Excel Integration

- Setup keycloak access tokens

# Oji Fibre Project

- Get data from the csv file to rapidscada/thingsboard, with solving the model in the platform too.

# Release Idaes-Service

Release the core of idaes-service as ahuora-model-loader, so that other people can use ahuora models in their pyomo work. 

# Proposals

- Data preprocessing. It's one of the biggest bottlenecks. Is there something needed there? Or should we just use node-red etc?
- Diagnostics - Write a proposal - some ideas are in [[current.biggest-bottlenecks]].
- Parameter Estimation - Write a proposal for a good methodology to do that as well. Surely we can test on the geothermal data pretty easily?
- Machine learning  of property packages.
