# LSL Heat Pump Digital Twin

- Control - PyFirmata on the valve, connected to MQTT maybe?

- What could we do to use the ahuora platform to DT it? What can we calculate?

## Potential extras for Steam Generating Heat Pump

- get a PLC and start programming a control system (later)


# Excel Integration

- Setup keycloak access tokens

# Oji Fibre Project

- Get data from the csv file to rapidscada/thingsboard, with solving the model in the platform too.

# Release Idaes-Service

Release the core of idaes-service as ahuora-model-loader, so that other people can use ahuora models in their pyomo work. 

# Proposals

- Data preprocessing. It's one of the biggest bottlenecks. Is there something needed there? Or should we just use node-red etc?
- Diagnostics - Write a proposal - some ideas are in [[current.biggest-bottlenecks]].
- Parameter Estimation - Write a proposal for a good methodology to do that as well. Surely we can test on the geothermal data pretty easily?
- Machine learning  of property packages.
