# A Repeatable Digital Twin Architecture for the AI era: Case study of a Butane Heat Pump Digital Twin

Building a digital twin of an industrial process is a complex and costly task. This paper discusses a Digital Twin developed for a Butane Heat Pump, from the sensor data collection all the way up to the first principles and ML models of the process. The Digital Twin Architecture has been designed to be easy to replicate in different types of processes with minimal overhead, and the attributes that enable this adaptation are discussed. This will enable more efficient operation of Heat Pumps and other types of processes through real-time model based decision making procedures.
