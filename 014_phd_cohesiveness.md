# PhD Cohesiveness

## What gap does my research fill?

> There is lots of academic articles about what a digital twin is, based on some example systems. There is little on how to systematically build a Digital Twin from scratch.

They arent "mass-produced". The goal is to build a framework, methodology, or process to do this - doing to digital twins what the industrial revolution did to clothes, what Wordpress did to websites, what shopify did to e-commerce.

## What is the research question?

Some more specific questions are mentioned in [007 Phd Plan](007_phd_plan.md).

I need to determine by analysis or design the fundamental properties (axioms, core principles, design laws, constraints) of the Ahuora Digital Twin Platform. Then, from those fundamental properties, I need to analyse how they interact, and what emergent properties come as a result of those axioms/design choices? Are these properties benifical or not? 

> How does each property of the Ahuora Digital Twin platform affect the development of a digital twin of a chemical process?

## What do I want to present?

> A Critial analysis of the ahuora platform, starting from design axioms, ans showing what properties result from them.

This can include showing my work on RBONs, and the properties RBONs provide in building a digital twin.

It can also include any other aspect of my work on the Ahuora Digital Twin Platform.


> A case study showing the development of a digital twin for a real factory

This will provide practical evidence to back up my theoretical analysis.

## What do I not want to focus on?

- UI design - I'm concerned about the functionality and order of doing things, not the layout.
- Management techniques about how to run a good software team - I want to learn this, but it's not the focus of my PhD
- Better software development practices and techniques - It'd be nice to write a paper on this, but it's not the focus. It only comes into focus when the software development techniques affect the process of building digital twins. My focus is on optimising the design of digital twins, not necessarily the development of the Ahuora Platform (though a cleaner development experience obviously make optimising the process of building digital twins better.) The main reason I want to avoid this is because it is hard to reason about the effects of niche changes on the quality/pace of development.
